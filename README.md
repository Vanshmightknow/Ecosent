Suppose you are working for XYZ Marketing, and they want to build a platform to  analyze social media sentiment (from Twitter, Facebook, etc.) to track customer  opinions about their brand in real-time. The platform should allow marketing teams to  generate real-time insights, track positive/negative sentiment, and produce  actionable reports
<P>Here app.py file has all the code combined in one file 
   The word document has steps that you need to follow after setting up AWS
   I have used AWS EC2, S3 buckets and Kinesis to stream live tweets
   For Sentiment analysis I have used a pre trained model named Roberta which is a seperate file </P>
